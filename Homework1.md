  Explanatory varible "x"
    Use this to train the AI
  Response Varible "y"
    What the AI should result in
   Supervised learning
    We know what both "x" and "y" are
   If "y" is discrete then it is a classification problem
   If "y" is continous then it is a regression problem
   Data Pipeline
    Stage 1:
     using a function to use "x" to guess "y" as accurately as possible
    Stage 2:
     Publishing the function in a software package
